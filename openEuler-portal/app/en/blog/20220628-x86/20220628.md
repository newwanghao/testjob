## 1. Introduction

As a free enterprise-level Linux operating system, CentOS 8 has attracted wide attention from the industry since it was discontinued at the end of 2021. The reason is not only that CentOS has a large number of users, but also that porting CentOS is not just a system reinstallation. Instead, the OS and its application software and service systems need to be replaced, adapted, ported, and rebuilt. Therefore, how to port applications efficiently and securely at low risks becomes a core concern of users.

There are many OS porting solutions in China. The open source OS openEuler is also one of the hot topics.

The openEuler kernel originates from Linux. It supports Kunpeng, x86, and other processors and can fully unleash the potential of computing chips. openEuler is ideal for database, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) scenarios. openEuler is one of the mainstream open source OSs compatible with CentOS in China. Compared with CentOS, openEuler optimizes core functions, such as process scheduling, memory management, and I/O read and write. In addition, features such as iSulaf for container, StraitVirt for virtualization, SecGear for confidential computing, and BiSheng JDKs are built outside the core.

The openEuler ecosystem is rich. More than 300 partners have joined the openEuler community, including well-known enterprises such as Intel, Marvel, and New H3C. Partners in the entire industry chain, including processors, completely built units, base software, application software, and industry customers, have joined the community. Currently, 14 mainstream OSVs (including Kylinsoft, UnionTech, Kylinsec, SUSE, and iSoft) have released openEuler-based commercial distributions, which have been widely used as the core systems of government sectors and industries such as carrier, finance, and electricity.

This article describes how to check x86 hardware compatibility before porting CentOS to openEuler (openEuler 20.03 LTS SP1).

## 3. Software Running and Hardware Compatibility Assessment Using x2openEuler

The openEuler community provides [x2openEuler](https://repo.oepkgs.net/openEuler/rpm/openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1/stable/contrib/x2openEuler/noarch/Packages/) to assess hardware, software, and system configuration. In terms of hardware, the compatibility between openEuler and boards that run properly on CentOS is assessed. The tool collects board information and generates reports in HTML format, visualizing hardware compatibility.

Download the x2openEuler tool from <https://repo.oepkgs.net/openEuler/rpm/openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1/contrib/x2openEuler/>.

## 4 Tool Deployment

```java
cd /opt/
rpm -ivh x2openEuler-2.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

Note: You need to install the RPM package as the root user. Currently, a network connection is required for downloading and installing dependencies. Install dependencies such as **bzip2-devel** as prompted.

```java
su x2openEuler
x2openEuler redis-db -init
```

Enter the IP address (127.0.0.1), port number (6379), database index (0. The value range is 0 to16), and password of the Redis database in sequence. The tool encrypts the password. If the Redis password is not set or is empty, press **Enter**.

```java
x2openEuler init source_centos7.6-openEuler20.03-LTS-SP1.tar.gz
```

Note: After x2openEuler is installed using an RPM package, the default resource package `source_centos7.6-openEuler20.03-LTS-SP1.tar.gz` is generated in the `/opt/x2openEuler` directory. To assess software porting from CentOS 8.2 to openEuler 20.03 LTS SP1, you need to obtain and import the required static resource package. For example, if the resource package is `source_centos8.2-openEuler20.03-LTS-SP1.tar.gz`, run the `x2openEuler init source_centos8.2-openEuler20.03-LTS-SP1.tar.gz` command to import the package.

## 6 Hardware Assessment Result Display

The hardware compatibility assessment report directly shows whether a board and the whole device are compatible with openEuler. If any item is not in the compatibility list, adaptation is required.

<img src="./x02.png">

The four tuples (VID, DID, SVID, and SSID) uniquely identify a board. As shown in the preceding figure, each board can be queried in the southbound compatibility list. Therefore, the hardware supports porting from CentOS to openEuler 20.03 LTS SP1.
