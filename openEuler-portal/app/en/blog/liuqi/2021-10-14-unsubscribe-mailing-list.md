The openEuler infrastructure team has received some inquiries from community maintainers and contributors about how to unsubscribe from openEuler mailing lists. Here are two methods:

### 1. Unsubscribe through email

Unsubscribe by email in either of two methods.  In an email with an unsubscription footer, click the unsubscription icon in the email footer to create and send an unsubscription email. Alternatively, send an email to `**-leave@openeuler.org`. The following describes how to unsubscribe from test@openeuler.org.

-
  For emails containing an unsubscribe footer, click test-leave@openeuler.org to create and send unsubscription emails. You do not need to include a specific email title or include any content.

  After you send the email, you will receive an email from test-bounces informing you that you have successfully unsubscribed from the mailing list.
