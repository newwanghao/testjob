# 1 Introduction to the Access Control Function

## 1.1 Access Control

The code of the openEuler community is hosted on Gitee. To ensure the code quality, when you submit a pull request (PR) on Gitee, the access control system is automatically triggered to check the coding specifications and build, installation, and interface changes. Then, the access control check result is returned to the PR comment, helping you locate problems and maintainers review code.

For the open-source access control code, visit https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins.

| x86-64/*repository_name* | Package build check in the 64-bit x86 environment | Implemented by maintainers and does not belong to the access control code.                              |
| aarch64/*repository_name*| Package build check in the AArch64 environment| Implemented by maintainers and does not belong to the access control code.                                                        |

In addition, the access control system supports the optional configuration of check items (check_openlibing and check_sca). The configuration file is stored in [ac.yaml](https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins/blob/master/src/ac/framework/ac.yaml). Code related to the PR output of each check item is stored in [gitee_comment.py](https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins/blob/master/src/build/gitee_comment.py).  

Currently, check_openlibing is implemented by calling the remote service (https://majun.osinfra.cn:8384/api/openlibing/codecheck), and check_sca is implemented by calling the remote service (https://sca-beta.osinafra.cn).

1. The code snippet scan (check_sca) and coding specification check (check_code) in the software package single-repository access control check are implemented by calling the Majun platform service.  

2. The maintenance personnel responsible for single-repository access control of software packages are the contact persons of corresponding problems on the openEuler and src-openEuler platforms. For OBS or infrastructure service problems, contact the corresponding maintenance personnel. For common problems and solutions, see [Access Control Troubleshooting Manual](https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins/blob/master/doc/%E9%97%A8%E7%A6%81%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98%E6%8E%92%E6%9F%A5%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8C.md).

## 2.2 Access Control Result Feedback

If you have any doubts about access control results, contact the related owner. We will solve the problem as soon as possible. If the problem cannot be solved quickly, you can submit an issue to the access control repository ([https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins](https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins)) to track the progress. After that, you can provide feedback on false alarms through PR comments. The statistics help us do better in the future.

Format of comments for marking false alarms: **/ci_unmistake build_no** or **/ci_mistake build_no <mistake_type> <ci_mistake_stage>**.

Note:

1. **ci_mistake** is used to mark a false alarm, and **ci_unmistake** is used to withdraw the mark. Either **ci_mistake** or **ci_unmistake** must be specified.  
2. **build_no** indicates the build number of a trigger project. When the access control starts, the access control task link and build number are printed in the comment. One PR can have multiple build results. Therefore, the build numbers are used to distinguish the build results. This parameter is mandatory.  
3. **mistake_type** indicates the false alarm type. This parameter is optional. You can select **ci** (access control), **obs**, or **infra** (infrastructure) or leave it blank.  
4. **ci_mistake_stage** indicates the phase in which the false alarm is generated. This parameter is optional. You can select one or more items from check_binary_file, check_package_license, check_package_yaml_file, check_spec_file, check_build, check_install, compare_package, and build_exception, or leave it blank. All items except build_exception correspond to access control check items. build_exception indicates that the access control system runs abnormally (for example, the access control result is not returned).  
5. The sequence of **mistake_type** and **ci_mistake_stage** can be changed.  

# 3 Access Control Code Rollout Process

Perform the three steps in sequence: 1. Submit a PR to the access control code repository and contact a maintainer for merging; 2. Generate a tag for the submission (contact the maintainer); 3. Update the container image (contact access control personnel [Wang Huan](https://e.gitee.com/open_euler/members/trend/wanghuan158), [Wei Shaowei](https://e.gitee.com/open_euler/members/trend/MementoMoriCheng), [Zheng Yaohui](https://gitee.com/open_euler/dashboard/members/zhengyaohui)). In a few cases, the access control personnel need to modify the Jenkins configuration.

## 3.1 Submitting and Merging a PR

The access control code is stored in [https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins](https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins). Contact a maintainer to integrate the code.

## 3.2 Generating a Tag

Theoretically, a tag can be generated for each commit. However, because not all PRs need to be merged and rolled out immediately, you do not need to generate a tag for each commit.  

<img src="./2022-03-21-ci_guild-06.png">  

## 3.3 Generate a container image.  

Currently, the access control environment is included in the container image. Therefore, each time you update the access control code, you must update the container image code as well. The image version is distinguished by tags.  

# 4 Running Node Customization

## 4.1 Current Node/Image List

<img src="./2022-03-21-ci_guild-07.png">  

The following table lists the nodes related to access control.  

| Node                                                        | Project                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| k8s-x86-soe and k8s-aarch64-soe                                | All access control projects in src-openEuler             |
| k8s-x86-oe                                                   | The trigger and comment projects in openEuler       |
| **k8s-x86-openeuler, k8s-x86-openeuler-20.03-lts, k8s-x86-openeuler-20.03-lts-sp1, k8s-x86-openeuler-20.03-lts-sp2, k8s-x86-openeuler-20.03-lts-sp3, k8s-x86-openeuler-20.09, k8s-x86-openeuler-21.03, k8s-aarch64-openeuler, k8s-aarch64-openeuler-20.03-lts, k8s-aarch64-openeuler-20.03-lts-sp1, k8s-aarch64-openeuler-20.03-lts-sp2, k8s-aarch64-openeuler-20.03-lts-sp3, k8s-aarch64-openeuler-20.09, k8s-aarch64-openeuler-21.03**| **x86-64 and aarch64 build projects in openEuler**|

Note:  
1. All projects in src-openEuler and the trigger and comment projects in openEuler are configured on the access control side and use the same environment. Therefore, the nodes are fixed.  

2. The code executed by the x86-64 and AArch64 build projects in openEuler is managed by the related SIGs and used in different environments. You can select the nodes listed **in bold**. To avoid impacting other Jenkins tasks, do not use other nodes.


## 4.2 Node Customization

You may need to customize access control nodes for some tasks.  

### 4.2.1 The base image lacks dependencies, and the dependency installation is time-consuming.

Dependencies can be installed during the running of the container environment provided by the access control system. Therefore, you are advised to run the **sudo yum install -y xxx** command in the running script to install a few dependencies. If you need to install a large number of dependencies, submit a dockerfile to the access control repository [https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins](https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins). The access control side reviews and integrates the dockerfile, creates an image, and then creates a running node.  

For details about the dockerfile format, visit https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-jenkins/blob/master/src/dockerfile/release-tools-dockerfile. Generally, you only need to modify the first two statements.  

```
FROM swr.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/openeuler/openjdk/OPENJDK:TAG
RUN set -eux; \
    yum install -y python3-pip cpio bsdtar expect openssh sudo vim git strace python-jenkins python3-requests python-concurrent-log-handler python3-gevent python3-marshmallow python3-pyyaml python-pandas python-xlrd python-retrying python-esdk-obs-python git 
```

### 4.2.2 The base image version is not openEuler.

In addition to compiling the dockerfile, you need to provide the base image of the corresponding version.  

### 4.2.3 The server architecture does not meet requirements.

In addition to the preceding two requirements, you need to deploy a server of the corresponding architecture, and then perform steps 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. In this case, the access control code needs to be modified.
