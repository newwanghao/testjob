## Ceph Progress in the openEuler Community
### Storage Related Topics on openEuler Developer Day 2022 (ODD 2022) 
[ODD 2022](https://www.openeuler.org/zh/interaction/summit-list/devday2022/) was an online developer conference held April 13, 2022 to April 15, 2022 and founded by the openEuler community of OpenAtom Foundation. The conference explored technical innovation for openEuler in server, cloud computing, edge computing, and embedded system scenarios, and officially released the all-scenario, long-term openEuler 22.03. The conference also presented joint innovation achievements of partners, shared business cases of large-scale deployment of openEuler in multiple industries, and held online meetings for community governance organizations. openEuler Ceph, built on native Ceph, is the high-quality, -reliability, and -performance version suited to the ARM architecture. The topics related to Ceph storage in ODD 2022 are as follows:  

* Impact of Cache Policies on Ceph Performance (Chi Xinze, XSKY)
  - This presentation described the impact of cache policies of different levels on performance in the Ceph RADOS architecture.
* Improving Ceph and Big Data Application Performance Based on the UADK Accelerator (Dai Zhiwei, Huawei)
  - Data storage encryption and compression require high CPU computing power. UADK is an SVA-based user space accelerator development kit for Kunpeng CPUs. It can accelerate and offload computation encryption and compression services. This presentation also described the Ceph data system and compression features, and adaptation progress and performance of UADK in Ceph and big data applications.
* Using Storage-Compute Decoupling and Operator Pushdown of Big Data + Ceph to Improve Compute and Storage Efficiency (Wu Qiqing, Huawei)
  - As a solution to implement data lakes, big data + Ceph uses data passthrough and operator pushdown schemes to decouple storage from compute, improving compute and storage efficiency and providing better performance and storage rate than HDFS.
* Accelerating High-Performance Computing Library Using ARM SVE Vector Instructions (Xu Guodong and Zhuang Haojian, Linaro)
  - For high-performance computing (HPC) and storage fields, Arm released the Scalable Vector Extenstion (SVE), which has evolved to SVE2 and SME (Armv9). In addition to SVE evolution, chain support, and software adaptation, this presentation also introduced the advantages of SVE and key development technologies that run on ISA-L and XXHash coding.
### openEuler 22.09 Ceph Version Planning
  * Enable the Kunpeng accelerator compression and encryption features.
  * Optimize performance.
  * Support Chinese cryptographic algorithms.
  * Enable and evaluate the Crimson feature.
  * Implement automatic shutdown and startup of Ceph clusters.

## [Ceph v17.2.0 Quincy Released](https://ceph.io/en/news/blog/2022/v17-2-0-quincy-released/)
Major Changes from Pacific:
* General
  - Filestore has been deprecated in Quincy. BlueStore becomes Ceph's default object store.
  - The `device_health_metric pool` has been renamed `.mgr`. It is now used as a common store for all `ceph-mgr` modules.
  - The `ceph pg dump` command now prints three additional columns: `LAST_SCRUB_DURATION`, `SCRUB_SCHEDULING`, and `OBJECTS_SCRUBBED`.
  - `WITH_LEVEL_DB` has been removed. Related services need to be migrated to RocksDB.
  - `osd_memory_target_autotune` is enabled by default, which sets the total RAM to 0.7.
* Rados
  - OSD: Ceph now uses `mclock_scheduler` as the default `osd_op_queue` for BlueStore OSDs to provide QoS.
  - MGR: `pg_autoscaler` can now be turned on and off globally with the `noautoscale` flag. By default, it is set to `on`.
  - OSD: The on-wire compression for osd-osd communication is supported and it is set to `off` by default.
  - OSD: Concise reporting of `slow ops` is saved in the cluster log. The old and more verbose logging behavior can be regained by setting `osd_aggrregated_slow_ops_logging` to `false`.
* RBD
  - rbd-nbd: The `rbd device attch` and `rbd device detach` commands are added, allowing for safe reattach after the `rbd-nbd` daemon is restarted since Linux kernel 5.14.
  - rbd-nbd: The `notrim` map option is added to support thick-provisioned images.
  - Large stabilization effort has been made for client-side persistent caching on SSD devices.
* RGW
  - RGW now supports rate limiting by `user` and by `bucket`. Rate limiting could be applied to all users and all buckets by using a global configuration.
  - The message format of the S3 bucket notification event is modified.
  - The behavior for Multipart Upload was modified so that only a CompleteMultipartUpload notification is sent at the end of the multipart upload. The POST notification at the beginning of the upload and the notifications that were sent on each part are no longer sent.
* CephFS
  - A file system can be created with a specific ID ("fscid"). This is useful in certain recovery scenarios (for example, when a monitor database has been lost and rebuilt, and the restored file system is expected to have the same ID as before).

## Recently Merged PRs
Recently, the PRs mainly focus on bug fixing. The following describes notable changes:
* BlueStore:
  - Disabled the NCB function on drives. The NCB code is used to restore the allocation map after the OSD crashes. The performance of the HDD is 20 times slower than that of the SSD. Therefore, this function is not applicable to the HDD environment. [pr#45340](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45340)
  - Fixed the NCB SimpleBitMap boundary check. [pr#45733](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45733)
  - Reconstructed the **get_block_extents** interface. [pr#45250](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/44250)
* Crimson:
  - Fixed the OSD crash caused by bufferlist parameter reference. [pr#45415](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45415) 
  - Disabled the pg-autoscaling function for crimson-osd in **vstart.sh**. [pr#45317](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45317)
  - Added the following functions: cmp xattr cancel operation ([pr#45774](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45774)), omap cmp ([pr#45630](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45630)), osd_op_assert_ver ([pr#45348](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45348))
* OSD:
  - Fixed the snapshot deletion bug. Snapshot deletion is restarted only after scrub is complete. In Ceph FS scenarios, the PG status can be restored during the deletion of a large number of snapshots. [pr#45785](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45785)
  - Supported truncation sequences in sparse reads. [pr#45103](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45103)
* Mon:
  - Modified the value range of `target_size_ratio` from `0.0->1.0` to `0.0->nolimit`. Solved the problem that the input ratio is greater than 1.0 when `ceph osd pool create <poolname> --target_size_ratio <ratio>` is used.
* Others:
  - Fixed some bugs in the dashboard and cephadm.
  - Fixed some bugs in RBD and GW.
  - Optimized documentation.
