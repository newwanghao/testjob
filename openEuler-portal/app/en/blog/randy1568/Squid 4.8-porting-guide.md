# Introduction

#### Squid Overview

Squid cache, or Squid for short, is a popular open-source proxy server and web cache server that runs on Unix systems, and released under GNU General Public License (GPL). Squid caches related requests as the frontend cache server of a web server to improve the speed of the web server, caches the World Wide Web, DNS, and other network searches for a group of people to share network resources, filters traffic to help ensure network security, and provides proxy access for a local area network. It has a long history of development and, with a rich function portfolio, can fit a wide scope of industry scenarios. In addition, it supports HTTP, FTP, and HTTPS, and IPv6 in the test version 3.0.  

Programming language: C++
