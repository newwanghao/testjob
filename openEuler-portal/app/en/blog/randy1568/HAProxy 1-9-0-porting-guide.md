## Introduction

#### Overview

HAProxy is a free and open-source software program written in C. It provides a high availability load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications, supports virtual hosts, and has a reputation for being fast and reliable.
Programming language: C

Brief description: web load balancer

#### Recommended Software Version

For details about how to install the openEuler OS, see https://docs.openeuler.org/en/docs/20.03_LTS_SP1/docs/Installation/Installation.html.    
Notes:
You are advised to select the "Server with GUI" installation mode.

## Installing HAProxy Using the RPM Package Obtained from a Mirror Site

If your server can access the network, run the "wget https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/kunpeng/yum/el/7/aarch64/Packages/web/haproxy-1.9.0-1.el7.aarch64.rpm" command to download the RPM package. Otherwise, visit https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/kunpeng/yum/el/7/aarch64/Packages/web/haproxy-1.9.0-1.el7.aarch64.rpm to download the package and copy it to the **/home** directory on the server.

Notes:
The RPM packages in the mirror site are compiled and packaged using open-source code, and then uploaded to the mirror site.

The following describes how to download the RPM package to the local PC and then upload it to the server.

1. Install HAProxy.

   ```bash
   rpm -ivh haproxy-1.9.0-1.el7.aarch64.rpm
   ```

2. View the installation directory.

   ```bash
   ls /usr/local/haproxy
   ```

## Operation and Verification

- Configure parameters.

  a. Open the **option-http_proxy.cfg** file.

    ```bash
    vi  /usr/local/haproxy/conf/option-http_proxy.cfg
    ```

  b. Modify the file as follows, and save and close the file:

    ```bash
    global
    maxconn      20000

- Start HAProxy.

  ```bash
  taskset -c 0-3 /usr/local/haproxy/sbin/haproxy -f /usr/local/haproxy/conf/option-http_proxy.cfg
  ```

- Verify HAProxy.

  ```bash
  ps -ef | grep haproxy
  ```

  The HAProxy process is displayed.

  Open the browser, enter http://*HAProxy IP address*:80 in the address box, and press **Enter**. The WebUI page of the backend server is displayed, indicating that HAProxy is running properly. Refresh the page. The page switches between backend servers.

  Notes:

  - (Optional) Stop HAProxy. Do not run this command when services are running.

    ```bash
    pkill haproxy
    ```

  - (Optional) Uninstall HAProxy and query the result.

    ```bash
    rpm -qa | grep haproxy
    ```

    ```bash
    rpm -e --nodeps haproxy-1.9.0
    ```

    ```bash
    rpm -qa | grep haproxy
    ```

    ```bash
    rm -rf /usr/local/haproxy
    ```
