Apache HTTP Server (Apache for short) is an open-source web server of the Apache Software Foundation. It can run on numerous operating systems (OSs) and is widely used due to its high security and compatibility with multiple platforms. It is fast and reliable, and can be extended using simple APIs to compile interpreters such as Perl and Python to the server.
